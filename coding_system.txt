System:
    1. Read the problem twice and ensure 
        you get the input and desired result correctly
    2. Write a solution
    3. Calmly debug and walk-through your solution with inputs
        again and again, do not hit run button, this is a must
        check for syntax and logic flaws
    4. Confirm it works for obvious test-cases/new test-cases

    5. Think of improvements and edge cases
            EDGE-CASES:
                When input is empty
                When input is a single value
                Complex input
                Complex scenarios - which involves logic tweaking/improvements            
    6. Repeat, step 2-4

    7. Once Satisfied, Check for syntax errors or minute errors 
    8. Hit Run (Think of it this way, everytime you hit run
        you lose money or its very expensive)
