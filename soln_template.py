Question

Improvement Question:
    What are the downside to this soln and
    how can it be improved?

PROMPT FOR IMPROVEMENT:
    Solved a coding problem using my own solution. Here’s the code for my solution:

    [Insert Your Solution Code Here]

    Please analyze the following:

    Identify any downsides or inefficiencies in my solution.
    Provide two optimized solutions that improve on my code in terms of time complexity, space complexity, or general efficiency.
    Include the time and space complexity for all three solutions (my solution, and the two optimized solutions).
    Address edge cases that my solution and the optimized solutions should handle.
    Present the output in one single file.
    Ensure the file includes detailed code comments for each solution and is written in Python.



NEW PROMPT:

### Prompt to Solve Coding Questions in a Structured Way  

Problem: [Insert Problem Statement Here]  

Step 1: Identify Key Concepts Needed  
- List out the fundamental concepts required to solve the problem (e.g., Two Pointers, Hash Maps, Recursion, Sorting).  
- Explain why these concepts are useful for this specific problem.  

Step 2: Break Down the Solution Approach  
- Concept 1: Explain how it applies to the problem.  
- Concept 2: Explain its role.  
- Repeat until all necessary ideas are covered.  

Step 3: Implement the Code  
- Write a clean and well-commented solution.  
- Ensure readability and maintain best practices.  

Step 4: Optimize and Improve  
- Discuss alternative approaches and trade-offs.  
- Optimize for time complexity and space complexity.  

Step 5: Follow-Up Questions to Deepen Understanding  
1. How would the solution change if the input was modified in some way (e.g., a doubly linked list instead of a singly linked list)?  
2. Can you solve this problem using a different approach, such as recursion or a stack?  
3. What if the input size was extremely large—how would memory constraints impact our approach?  
4. How does this compare to another method in terms of efficiency?  
5. What is the worst-case runtime complexity for this solution?  

This structured approach ensures a clear understanding of the problem and prepares for follow-up discussions in interviews. Let me know if you want me to apply this format automatically for future coding questions.
